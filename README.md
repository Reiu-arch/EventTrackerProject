# EventTrackerProject
## Overview
In this JPA project a user will be able to post, comment (add a category to comment) and follow other users. At the moment im currently brain storming how the syntax would be used in only allowing a user to create a post, comment or follow other users. Completed sections include User and half of the Post table. Other tables include the post comment and comment category. 

## Technologies Used
* Postman
* Spring Tool Suite
* Spring Boot and JPA
* MySQL Workbench
* REST
* Java
* JSON

## Lessons Learned 
Completing a database with an authenticated user is far harder than it seems when it comes to testing and producing with this new technology learned. I still need to iterate over the information given to me in order for me to gain a more profound understanding of REST controller, services, repository, and service implementation. Im currently refrencing previous projects to try and produce a new understanding of my abilities.
